    "Persistence is \"the continuance of an effect after its cause is removed\". In the context of storing data in a computer system, this means that the data survives after the process with which it was created has ended. In other words, for a data store to be considered persistent, it must write to non-volatile storage.\n",

    "To accomplish data persistence we use a process called serialization.\n",

    "It is a process to convert a data structure into ad linear form that can be stored or transmitted over a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In python serialization allows us to take complex object structure and transform it into a stream of bytes that can be save to a disk or sent over a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Serialization is sometimes also called marshalling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to convert these serialized data back to their original data structure we use process called deserialization or unmarshalling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has three different module for this purpose:\n",
    "- `pickle`\n",
    "- `marshal`\n",
    "- `json`\n",

    "`json` is newest one convenient and widely accepted for data exchange and it serializes objects in human readable form and is light\n",
    "\n",
    "`pickle` serializes objects in binary format thus not human readable, but its faster and works everywhere and allows to custom define objects.\n",

    "- Don’t use the marshal module. It’s used mainly by the interpreter, and the official documentation warns that the Python maintainers may modify the format in backward-incompatible ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The json module and XML are good choices if you need interoperability with different languages or a human-readable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Python pickle module is a better choice for all the remaining use cases. If you don’t need a human-readable format or a standard interoperable format, or if you need to serialize custom objects, then go with pickle."

    "- `pickle.dumps(obj, protocol=None, *, fix_imports=True, buffer_callback=None)` Return the pickled representation of the object obj as a bytes object, instead of writing it to a file.\n",
    "- `pickle.load(file, *, fix_imports=True, encoding=\"ASCII\", errors=\"strict\", buffers=None)` read the pickled representation of an object from the open file object and return the reconstituted object hierarchy specified therein. This is equivalent to `Unpickler(file).load()`\n",

    "- `pickle` is binary serialization while `json` is text serialization in `utf-8` format thus human readable.\n",
    "- `pickle` is widely used in python ecosystem only while `json` is interoperable and widely used outside of python ecosystem.\n",
    "- `json` can only serialize a subset of the python built-in types only and no custom classes, while `pickle` can do that.\n",
    "- `json` is far secure than `pickle` as deserializing it doesn't cause any arbitrary code execution.\n",

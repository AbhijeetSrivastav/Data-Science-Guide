    "- Lambda expressions in python or any language have roots in lambda calculus, a model of computation invented by Alonzo Church in 1930s.\n",
    "- Lambda functions are also referred to as lambda abstractions.\n",
    "- Lambda calculus can encode any computation. It is turing complete, but contrary to the concept of turing machine, it is pure and does not keep any state.\n",
    "- The imperative programming language inherit their computation model from Turing machine computational model (Python, C).\n",
    "- While non imperative programming language inherit their computational model from lambda calculus (Java).\n",
    "- But as lambda and turing computational model can be translated to each other based on Alonzo-Turing hypothesis, this lead to introduction of inter operable functions in these languages. Like python being a turing base has `lambda` function which is lambda calculus based.\n",
    "- Python not originally a functional language, but it adopted some functional concepts in 1994 like `map, filter, reduce, lambda`"

    "\n",
    "- **Dimensions compatibility:** Arrays must have compatible dimensions. Dimensions are considered compatible if they are equal or if one of them is 1. A dimension of 1 means that the corresponding array's element will be repeated along that dimension to match the other array's shape.\n",
    "- **Trailing singleton dimensions:** Arrays can have trailing singleton dimensions (dimensions with size 1). These dimensions are treated as if they were equal and broadcast accordingly.\n",
    "- **Matching leading dimensions:** Leading dimensions (dimensions at the beginning of the shape) must match exactly.\n",

    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
